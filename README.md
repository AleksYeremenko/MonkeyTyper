# MonkeyTyper

This project was originally part of a university assignment where students could choose between multiple topics 
(**Databases**, **Hexxagon**, **2D platformer**, **Monkey Typer**, etc.).  
I selected the Monkey Typer idea and extended it far beyond the basic requirements by:

- implementing advanced word logic with dynamic movement and input validation,  
- customizing fonts, speed, size, and visual feedback for typed characters,  
- modularizing the game architecture into `core`, `states`, `ui`, `data`, `gameplay` for better scalability.

The result is a complete 2D typing game fully written in **C++** using **SFML**.

## 🧩 Features

- Dynamic word movement from right to left with randomized speed  
- Word removal through real-time typing input  
- Timer and score tracking system  
- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect input (green/red highlights)  
- Configurable fonts, word speed, size, and game difficulty  
- Modular architecture (`core`, `states`, `gameplay`, `ui`, `data`)
